# TDD kata
A starting project for FizzBuzz kata in TDD

## Stage 1:
Fizz Buzz

Return “fizz”, “buzz” or “fizzbuzz”.

For a given natural number greater than zero return:

- “fizz” if the number is dividable by 3
- “buzz” if the number is dividable by 5
- “fizzbuzz” if the number is dividable by 15
- the same number if no other requirement is fulfilled

## Stage 2:
Write a program that calculates and prints fizzbuzz as per above rules for numbers from 1 to 100.

## Stage 3 - Change of rules:
- Print fizz if it is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it
- Print buzz if it is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it
